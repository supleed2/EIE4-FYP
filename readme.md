# StackSynth - Final Project

This repository contains the source files and notes from my Final Project, as part of my Masters of Engineering in Electronics and Information Engineering at Imperial College London.

StackSynth is an educational synthesizer platform based on the STM32L432, used in the 3rd Year Embedded Systems module, with lab notes available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/edstott/ES-synth-starter). The ARM Cortex-M4 based CPU is not optimised for the Digital Signal Processing operations needed for complex audio waveform generation.

The goal of this project was to create the SystemVerilog modules and code for an FPGA-based extension module for StackSynth, to increase the audio ability and performance of the synthesizer while providing future Embedded Systems students an opportunity to develop code for an integrated [VexRiscV](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) RISC-V System-on-Chip.

Notes taken during this project primarily consist of links for useful reading and reference materials, and is available in [this document](./notes/readme.md).
